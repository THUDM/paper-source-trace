# paper-source-trace

## Prerequisites
- Linux
- Python 3.9
- PyTorch 1.10.0+cu111

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/THUDM/paper-source-trace.git
cd paper-source-trace
```

Please install dependencies by

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## PST Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1I_HZXBx7U0UsRHJL5JJagw?pwd=bft3) with password bft3, [Aliyun](https://open-data-set.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oag-benchmark/kddcup-2024/PST/PST.zip) or [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/namx1n55xzqil4zbkd5sv/PST.zip?rlkey=impcbm2acqmqhurv2oj0xxysx&dl=1).
The paper XML files are generated by [Grobid](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/) APIs from paper pdfs.

## Run Baselines for [KDD Cup 2024](https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/pst_kdd_2024/)
First, download DBLP dataset from [AMiner](https://opendata.aminer.cn/dataset/DBLP-Citation-network-V16.zip).
Put the unzipped PST directory into ``data/`` and unzipped DBLP dataset into ``data/PST/``.

```bash
cd $project_path
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='?'  # specify which GPU(s) to be used
export PYTHONPATH="`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH"

# Method 1: Random Forest
python rf/process_kddcup_data.py
python rf/model_rf.py  # output at out/kddcup/rf/

# Method 2: Network Embedding
python net_emb.py  # output at out/kddcup/prone/

# Method 3: SciBERT
python bert.py  # output at out/kddcup/scibert/
```

## Results on Valiation Set

|  Method  | MAP   |
|-------|-------|
| Random Forest  | 0.21420 |
| ProNE | 0.21668 |
| SciBERT  | 0.29489 |

## Paper Sharing Group

Hello everyone,

We've created an online WeChat paper-sharing group where each member is required to share 2 computer science papers every week. We have established mechanisms of rewards and penalties for members who do and do not share papers as required. You are free to join or leave at any time. Welcome to join us!
